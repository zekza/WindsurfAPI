/**
 * Prompt-level tool-call emulation for Cascade.
 *
 * Cascade's protocol has no per-request slot for client-defined function
 * schemas (verified against exa.cortex_pb.proto — SendUserCascadeMessageRequest
 * fields 1-9, none accept tool defs; CustomToolSpec exists only as a trajectory
 * event type, not an input). To expose OpenAI-style tool-calling to clients
 * anyway, we serialise the client's `tools[]` into a text protocol the model
 * follows, then parse the emitted tool markers back out of the cascade text
 * stream.
 *
 * Protocol:
 *   - System preamble tells the model the exact emission format
 *   - Supported dialects:
 *     - openai_json_xml: <tool_call>{"name":"...","arguments":{...}}</tool_call>
 *     - glm47: <tool_call><function>\n<arg_key>...</arg_key>\n<arg_value>...</arg_value>\n</tool_call>
 *     - kimi_k2: <|tool_calls_section_begin|>...<|tool_call_begin|>...</tool_call>
 *   - On emit, stop generating (we close the response with finish_reason=tool_calls)
 *   - Tool results come back as role:"tool" messages; we fold them into
 *     synthetic user turns wrapped in <tool_result tool_call_id="...">...</tool_result>
 *     so the next cascade turn can see them.

// "<workspace>" you may see is a redaction marker, NOT a literal path.
// Issue #98 (nalayahfowlkest-ship-it): `find <workspace> -type f` was

// "workspace: No such file or directory". The hint must explicitly
// forbid passing the literal token to shell tools.
const WORKSPACE_PATH_HINT = 'Workspace path hidden; "<workspace>" is a redaction marker, NOT a path — never pass it to shell tools (shell reads "<" as redirection). Use "." for cwd or relative paths. If asked for cwd, say unavailable.';

// #108 (nalayahfowlkest-ship-it / zhangzhang-bit): the upstream planner
// injects its own <workspace_information> / <workspace_layout> block
// describing a placeholder directory the proxy created on the server
// filesystem. Models read that block as the user's real project and
// "analyze" the stub instead of asking the local tools to read the
// user's real workspace. Pin precedence in neutral wording — the
// project's tool-preamble rule (feedback_tool_preamble_rules.md) bans
// jailbreak-flavored phrases like "ignore" / "for this request only"
// because Opus' injection guard trips on them.
const WORKSPACE_STUB_OVERRIDE = 'Any `<workspace_information>` or `<workspace_layout>` block elsewhere in this conversation describes a placeholder directory created by the proxy infrastructure, not the user\'s project. Treat the path above as the authoritative working directory and use Read / Glob / Bash to discover real project contents.';
const TOOL_RESULT_CONTINUATION_HINT = 'Tool result metadata: this is the result of the previous assistant tool call, not a new user request. Use it only to continue the latest real user request. If the result is sufficient, provide the final answer and stop; call more tools only when strictly required to answer that latest request.';

// User-message-level fallback preamble.
//
// MINIMAL by design. The proto-level tool_calling_section override
// (buildToolPreambleForProto) is authoritative and carries the full
// function schemas. This fallback is only a short pointer that exists so
// Cascade NO_TOOL-mode models which ignore SectionOverride (issue #22)
// still see that tools exist and how to emit them.
//
// Why tiny? An earlier full-schema version (~1600+ chars of
// `### FnName / parameters schema: / ```json {...}```` blocks prepended
// to the user message) was reliably flagged by Opus-class injection
// detectors as "a pasted Claude Code system prompt in the user turn".
// The SHAPE — a wall of `### ToolName` blocks with JSON schemas — is the
// signature of Claude Code's own system prompt, so when it appears in a
// user slot the model treats it as a prompt-injection attempt and
// refuses to call tools. Keeping the fallback to a single short line of
// prose avoids that misidentification while still telling #22 models
// the protocol and listing tool names for recognition.
//
// Hard constraints:
//   - Single paragraph, no `### …` headers, no fenced ```json blocks.
//   - No jailbreak vocab ("IGNORE", "for THIS request only", etc.).
//   - No `---` fences or `[bracketed titles]`.
//   - Keep total emitted length under ~512 chars even with many tools
//     (names only, no schemas).

To call a function, output ONE valid JSON object on a single line — starting with "{" and ending with "}". NO markdown code fence. NO prose before or after. NO leading commentary.

Use this exact shape:
{"function_call":{"name":"<function_name>","arguments":{<param>:<value>,...}}}

Rules:
1. Output ONLY the JSON object. NO \`\`\`json fence. NO "Here you go:" prefix. NO trailing explanation.
2. "arguments" must be a JSON object whose keys match the function's parameter schema.
3. The functions ARE available. DO NOT respond with "I cannot read files", "I don't have direct access", "please paste the file", or any similar refusal — those phrases are forbidden. Call the function instead.
4. **NEVER FABRICATE OUTPUT.** Do NOT guess the result of a function call. Do NOT invent timestamps, file contents, command outputs, search results, or any other data that a function would have produced. If the user asks for the output of \`echo $(date +%s)\`, \`ls\`, \`cat README.md\`, or anything similar, you have NO way to know the answer — you MUST call the function. Hallucinated outputs are worse than refusing; the only correct response is the function_call JSON.
5. If the user's request describes ANY action a function could perform — running a shell command, reading a file, searching the web, applying a patch — call that function. Do not "answer from memory" for these requests; memory cannot produce live data.
6. After emitting one function_call JSON object, STOP generating immediately. The caller will run the function and feed the result back as a "tool" message.
7. To call MULTIPLE functions in parallel, emit MULTIPLE JSON objects, one per line. Each line stands on its own.
8. If — and only if — the user is plainly chatting (e.g. "hello", "thanks", "explain X concept") and no function is relevant, respond with plain text. Never mix plain text with JSON in the same response.
9. The function-call result will arrive as a normal user/tool turn; you can call additional functions on subsequent turns until the task is done.`,
